# MongoDB TypeScript Next.js CRUD Project


This project implements a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation for managing books using MongoDB, TypeScript, and Next.js 14 with API routes. It provides a simple yet powerful setup for building a book management system.

## Features

- **Book Management:** Allows users to perform CRUD operations on books, including adding new books, updating existing ones, and deleting them.
- **API Routes:** Implements API routes for handling backend logic, ensuring separation of concerns and maintainability.
- **TypeScript Support:** Utilizes TypeScript for enhanced type safety, making the codebase more robust and easier to maintain.
- **Next.js 14:** Employs Next.js 14 for server-side rendering (SSR), providing better performance and SEO optimization.

## Technologies Used
- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database for storing book data.
- **TypeScript:** A statically typed superset of JavaScript for building scalable applications.
- **Next.js 14:** A React framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) web applications.
- **API Routes:** Next.js API routes for handling backend logic.
